**misc infos:**

good 3d retouch to best show the colored version (didn't ask but cool, I didn't see the raw scan yet but it seems good) - beard + one mesh + fill missing polygons | not good - face nonbeard (wtf u done to my eyes and mouth) :D nvm 

Raw scan wrl full color > meshlab > stl (25mb) > blender > decimate 0.25, smooth > STL (5mb)

this is just a first scan I uploaded, this is from a 60~ mini hd (not full hd I think) cameras at the booth in the mall near where I live, pretty cool!

I will upload more scans made with:

- my structure sensor
- itseez3d
